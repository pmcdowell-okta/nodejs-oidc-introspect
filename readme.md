## Validate JWT id_token or access_token using Okta Introspect

This is not an especially interesting.

The use case is to validate an *id_token* or *access_token* generated by Okta.
 
Okta has two Authorization Servers:
 * Standard OIDC Service *(for sso)*
 * Authroization Service *(for Oauth Access Token)*
 
If you break open a token, you can tell which Authorization Service the request came from. This code does that, checks it against the **/introspect** service and return 1 for good, 0 for bad.

I don't think this is a big feat, but others might find it useful

Btw, my ClientID's and Secrets are in there, all are for non-production services, just left them in.

Enjoy..
